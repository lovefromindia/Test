<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">I had come across this word <span style="background-color: #ffe599; color: orange;">“PORN”</span> when I was too mature
i.e. 15 years old, at least we boys always overestimate our matureness when we
are teenager.</span></li>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace; text-align: center;">
</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;</span>Some of you might have bad, some might have mischievous friends in your
group but I was lucky as I had neither of them. Instead I had outstanding
friends because they had always stand outside of our class. Anyways, one of my friend (assume name as raj)
came and told us about this and it was like eureka moment for him. He was never
that excited for team project, debates, exams and later we found out why. He
had found this from his gully group boys in society that he lived. Now this
gully group’s friendship was like smoking cigarettes (Both being injurious to
health).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><br /></span>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">This group comprises of boys from all group ages like college
graduates, diploma degree holders, school going students. They had all been in
group for specific tasks such as adults were in group to give responsible
advices</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">to students about how to live
life (after ruining their own), diploma degree holders talks about most how to
deal with challenges of life such as playing clash of clans infront of parents,
how to not get caught in exam while cheating etc. But I must say that they were
great believer in younger generation i.e. students as who can give such most
responsible tasks like “Go bring me some water”, ”Go bring that cricket ball
from that house” to students. </span><i><span style="font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;">Itni jimaedari ka kaam toh big boss bhi task mein
nhi deta.</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"> You know what I mean. So they introduce raj to the ‘porn thing’.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Moving further, raj explained us like he was presenting a
startup idea and we were investors as he was convincing us to watch for once.
Our group had one member, let’s assume his name as ‘smit’. Now he was like a
guy who had been boasting since he had not even learnt to speak. He told us
“Listen guys, I know about this from long time, this is bad thing to watch. But
I had managed to convince my parents to allow me to watch this for once a
month.” </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;"><i>This was like Public place me Gaand me khujli aana and successfully
usko khujalna </i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">“EXTREMELY DIFFICULT”</span><i style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"> </i><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">.
I know you are now thinking that I am lying but I swear this were his exact
words. I told you na about his habit of boasting. This was obviously false as
</span><i><span style="font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;">smit woh ladka tha jisne apni crush ke saath baat karne mein 2 saal lagaye the
aur jab baat ki bhi thi tab bhi sirf crush ke farewell ke din bye bola tha</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">,also
he feared to run in school’s corridors because of CCTV camera. </span><span style="font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;"><i>Samaj rahe ho
kitna fattu tha banda.</i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"> </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><br /></span>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Ok further, we gave a moment of thought about whether to
watch porn video. You, readers would have accepted to watch porn in a moment,
but I am not you, I was responsible about my future so I accepted the offer in
a quantum second. Most of us were responsible guys like me and so being more
responsible we agreed to give it a try. After all, this was a massive upgrade
from watching 4 seconds’ kissing scenes in movies. If kissing scenes were shots
then this was a whole beer bottle. Also in our school it was a proud to watch porn. I mean many people in our school feel proud that how they had websites' accounts to watch online these shitty videos.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">So we agreed and decided to meet at a small garden to take
porn videos brought by raj since it was our safehouse.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">We arrived on time. I mean we were on time,
that boys who were late when GOD was distributing brain, were on time. Now I
could die with satisfaction! We as usual sit at our favorite spot</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">and raj was making arrangements with his tablet
to share these videos. We then decided to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">watch alone&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">at our house. Mine is a large family so sometimes i watched in garden only as negligible people come there. And today’s bitter
truth is people don’t socialize much and don’t care about what other people
are doing. I mean I can’t understand this was a curse to human kind or blessing
for me.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><br /></span>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Anyways, this continued.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">After a year later, I also got my personal phone and watching porn
increased with this. Then, not just at home alone but I started to watch the
porn maximum in that garden as it was silent. This continued for two years, both
at home and garden. What an idiot I was, wasting my productive time in this
shit.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><br /></span>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">After that, as expected
a villain(I felt at that time) had arrived in my story. He was a kid, annoying kid I would say.
</span><i><span style="font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;">Ungli karne wale dekhe hai, ha yeh wahi category ka janwaaar tha</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">He also started to look in my phone. I first
kindly said to this boy to go, but then when he didn’t listen to me then it was
time to teach him a lesson. And so i invited him also to watch (Just kidding).
I don’t want him there and so I stood up and scared him to go away. This was a
big mistake. He came again with his mom and dad and most interesting part was i
didn’t see them coming. You can assume the rest. I was feeling that it was a
raid on me by official anti-porn council or something like that.</span></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><i><span style="font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;">Agar who ladka ungli karnewala tha toh uska baap toh ungli
karne mein uske bhi baap nikla</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">. Yes i was caught and was given a great speech
by little boy’s parents. They told me all great proverbs, sayings and thoughts.
Leave that, also my parents were called and I had got in a big trouble. I had
expected the end of life that moment but something was different that time. My
parents had knowledge about hormonal changes and were ready to tell me about how
to handle them. After then I never touched that topic and also not talked about
porn. How? This i have discussed in solution section.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;</span></span></li>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Now after four years, with Google and being much more
responsive, today I know that why watching porn is bad. And believe me </span><b style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><span style="color: red;">IT’S TOO BAD TO WATCH PORN</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">. Also I sometimes wonder
what had happened</span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">if my parents had beaten
me up that day and not explained this with enough calm, then I would not be
able to control my habit and remove it. If my parents would have been angry at
me that day, then i would be so angry at my parents because of that teenager
ego that I would not stop that porn thing. So lesson for parents also that&nbsp;</span></li>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><i><b><u>Real moral of the story</u>:&nbsp;</b></i>is that <span style="color: red;">don’t<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>watch porn at all</span>. I can give hundred of

none of you would read it. So here I am directly giving you summary “<b><span style="color: red;">Don’t

yourself from watching porn.&nbsp;</span></li>

<ul style="text-align: left;">

</ul>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;"><br /></span>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Cue is a
kind of hint for your mind to do tasks automatically. Like you yawn and that
gives you a cue that now you need to sleep. Like you see your morning shoes and
that triggers a cue that you have to get up to go to walk.</span></span></li>

were two: 1)When I was bored 2)When I was alone at home . These were difficult
to find. But I had decided to stop that habit so after few days' effort, I had found
these cues.</span></span></li>

<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">&nbsp;Whenever I was bored, I used to take 20 min
break and would do certain activities like watching standup comedy, to boost my
mood and also to have some laughs. Also I had made sure that, that comedy
standup act doesn’t have any adult content like have jokes on porn and all. You
can find on what standup was based, in description of video or thumbnails. Yes
many times you will feel strong urge to watch porn, this would be the hardest
part. You have make advance plans that how would you will manage this. I had
managed this with some of my favorite snacks and music. &nbsp;Also, after I had stopped watching porn, I had
rewrite my this habit also. I had replaced my habit of watching standup comedy
with book reading of my choice for 30 min. Consistency is necessary.</span></span></li>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Whenever

<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Best of luck from my side.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot;, courier, monospace;">Also if you agree with me and know someone who you care about, if has this addiction, don’t share this post, but <b><u>YOU</u></b> himself explain him why porn addiction is bad and how to stop it. Because I had personally my loved ones(My parents),explaining me and not an unknown blogger. So you should make him “more responsible” and become a life changer for him/her.</span></li>
